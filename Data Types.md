# JavaScript

## Variables

- JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types 
of data types in JavaScript. These are:
  - Primitive data type
  - Non-primitive (reference) data type
- JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable 
because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data 
type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For example: <br/>
   var a=40;//holding number  <br/>
   var b="Rahul";//holding string  <br/>
