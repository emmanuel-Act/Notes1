## Variables

- A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable. 
- There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).
  - Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
  - After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
  - JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
- Example of JavaScript variable:
  - <script>  <br/>
      var x = 10; <br/>
      var y = 20; <br/>  
      var z=x+y;  <br/>  
      document.write(z); <br/> 
    </script>
